title: Summary and Setup
---

What do we want people to have already done before the lesson?
 Do they need to do anything in actual fact, unlikely to be as many follow along sections as normal carpentaries training

It's probably a good idea that we have them bring along a dataset/repository in github that they can mess around with.

We could run them through getting a DOI and all the other things and stuff.

OR

We could have a standard one that they work with, which would be linked below

## Data Sets

<!--
FIXME: place any data you want learners to use in `episodes/data` and then use
       a relative link ( [data zip file](data/lesson-data.zip) ) to provide a
       link to it, replacing the example.com link.
       
Have created the folder 'data' under episodes in case we do want to provide a test/example dataset for use
-->

Below is a sample data set that you can use to follow along, or please feel free to use a dataset that you have.

Please ensure that the dataset can be shared openly, so does not contain any personal or sensitive data, any consent that would be needed has been granted, and sharing is allowed by any contractual obligations you have with the data.

While you do not actually have to share this data, this is just incase it does get shared openly.

Download the [data zip file](https://github.com/RicCampbell/FAIR4RS_repos_dois/tree/main/episodes/data) and unzip it to your Desktop

## Software Setup

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

### Details

Setup for different systems can be presented in dropdown menus via a `spoiler`
tag. They will join to this discussion block, so you can give a general overview
of the software used in this lesson here and fill out the individual operating
systems (and potentially add more, e.g. online setup) in the solutions blocks.

No specific software will be required for this lesson, however please make sure you can access your account on the University of Sheffield's institutional repository [ORDA](https://orda.shef.ac.uk).
